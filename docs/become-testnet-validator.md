# Becoming a TestNet Validator

If you intend to become a [MainNet Validator](become-mainnet-validator.md), it will be good practice to fist run a validator node on TestNet to become familiar with the process.

>**IMPORTANT**: Whenever you use `undcli` to send Txs or query the chain ensure you pass the correct data to the `--chain-id` and if necessary `--node=` flags so that you connect to the correct network!

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you have gone through the following docs:

1. [Installing the software](installation.md)
2. [Join the Public TestNet](join-testnet.md)
3. [Accounts and Wallets](accounts-wallets.md)
4. **TestNet** Chain ID - if you haven't already, you can get the current chain ID by running:

```
jq --raw-output '.chain_id' $HOME/.und_mainchain/config/genesis.json
```

The above command assumes you have downloaded the TestNet genesis to the default `$HOME/.und_mainchain` directory.

>**Important**: you will need an account with sufficient UND to self-delegate to your validator node.

>**Tip**: if you intend to fully participate in the running of **TestNet**, your node will need to be permanently available and online. In which case, you will need to investigate running `und` as a [background service](run-und-as-service.md)

## Creating a validator

The first thing you will need is your node's Tendermint validator public key. This will be used to register your node as a Validator on the network. To get the key, open a terminal and run:

```bash
und tendermint show-validator
```
This will output your node's public key. Make a note of it, as it will be required soon.

>**Important**: Before continuing, ensure your full node has fully synced with TestNet and downloaded all the blocks (this may take a while, so go and make a brew). You can check the current network block height in the [TestNet block explorer](https://explorer-testnet.unification.io). For each block your full node syncs, you will see:
`I[2020-01-15|11:45:07.782] Executed block module=state height=37285 validTxs=0 invalidTxs=0`
When the height is the same as the current network block number, your full node has completed syncing.

To create your Validator, you will need to generate, sign and broadcast a special transaction to the network which will register your Tendermint validator public key and stake the amount of UND specified (via self-delegation). Run the following command, modifying as required:

```bash
undcli tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=STAKE_IN_NUND \
  --pubkey=NODE_TENDERMINT_PUBLIC_KEY \
  --moniker="YOUR_EV_MONIKER" \
  --website="YOUR_WEBSITE_URL" \
  --identity=16_DIGIT_KEYBASE_IO_ID \
  --details="NODE_DESCRIPTION" \
  --security-contact="SECURITY_CONTACT_EMAIL" \
  --chain-id=CHAIN_ID \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --min-self-delegation="1" \
  --gas="auto" \
  --gas-prices="0.25nund" \
  --gas-adjustment=1.5 \
  --from=SELF_DELEGATOR_ACCOUNT
```

**Mandatory fields**

`STAKE_IN_NUND`: the amount in nund you want to delegate to yourself. For example, if you want to stake 1000 UND, enter 1000000000000nund.

>**Tip**: You can use the built in `undcli` conversion tool to calculate this:

```
undcli convert 1000 und nund.
```

>**Important**: do not attempt to stake more than you have in your account, and ensure you have enough UND to pay for the transaction fees, and enough left over for future transactions!

`NODE_TENDERMINT_PUBLIC_KEY`: Your node's tendermint public key, obtained earlier via the `und tendermint show-validator` command.

`CHAIN_ID`: the chain you are creating a validator for. This was obtained previously via the `jq` command.

`SELF_DELEGATOR_ACCOUNT`: the name of the account being used to stake self-delegated UND and sign the transaction — for example, the identifier you entered when running the `undcli keys add` command earlier to create/import an account.

`YOUR_EV_MONIKER`: a moniker which will publicly identify your EV on the network.

**Optional fields**

>**Tip**: Ensure you create your validator with as much of the following additional information as you can. It will be publicly visible, and help potential stakers connect with you

`YOUR_WEBSITE_URL`: the URL for the site promoting your validation node

`16_DIGIT_KEYBASE_IO_ID`: Your 16 digit public [keybase.io](https://keybase.io) PGP public key ID if you have one and want to associate your ID to your validator node.

`NODE_DESCRIPTION`: a brief description of your validator node

`SECURITY_CONTACT_EMAIL`: Email address for the security contact for your validator node

**Commission Rates**

Your commission rates can be set using the `--commission-rate` , `--commission-max-change-rate` and `--commission-max-rate` flags.

`--commission-rate`: The % commission you will earn from delegators’ rewards. Keeping this low can attract more delegators to your node.

`--commission-max-rate`: The maximum you will ever increase your commission rate to — you cannot raise commission above this value. Again, keeping this low can attract more delegators.

`--commission-max-change-rate`: The maximum you can change the commission-rate by in any one change request. For example, if your maximum change rate is 0.01, you can only make changes in 0.01 increments, so from 0.10 (10%) to 0.09 (9%).

>**Important**: The values for `--commission-max-change-rate` and `--commission-max-rate` flags cannot be changed after the create-validator command has been run.

Finally, the `--min-self-delegation` flag is the minimum amount of `nund` you are required to keep self-delegated to your validator, meaning you must always have _at least_ this amount self-delegated to your node.

**Example**

```bash
undcli tx staking create-validator \
--amount=1000000000000nund \
--pubkey=undvalconspub1zcjduepq6yq7drzefkavsrxhxk69cy63tj3r... \
--moniker="MyAwesomeNode" \
--website="https://my-node-site.com" \
--details="My node is awesome" \
--security-contact="security@my-node-site.com" \
--chain-id=UND-Mainchain-TestNet-v3 \
--commission-rate="0.05" \
--commission-max-rate="0.10" \
--commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
--min-self-delegation="1000000000" \
--gas="auto" \
--gas-prices="0.25nund" \
--gas-adjustment=1.5 \
--from=my_new_wallet
```

The command will return a Tx hash, which you can use to query whether or not the transaction was successful:

```bash
undcli query tx TX_HASH --chain-id UND-Mainchain-TestNet-v3
```

>**Tip**: you can set the `--broadcast-mode` flag in the command to `block`. This will tell `undcli` to wait for the transaction to be processed in a block before returning the result. This will take up to 5-6 seconds to complete, but the Tx result will be included in the output.

### Verify

You can verify your node is registered as a validator by running:

```bash
undcli query staking validator \
$(undcli keys show SELF_DELEGATOR_ACCOUNT --bech=val -a) \
--chain-id=CHAIN_ID
```

replacing `SELF_DELEGATOR_ACCOUNT` and `CHAIN_ID` accordingly.
